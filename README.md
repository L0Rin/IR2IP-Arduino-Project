Server Part
Server part contains the receiving codes from Arduino. For posting the data here we are using the get request.
Code is written in such a way that both Get and Post request can be used for posting data to server.
GET - Requests data from a specified resource
POST - Submits data to be processed to a specified resource
Also it receives the data on server and insert the IR codes in database.
